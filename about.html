					Hi there, I'm Ryan. I care about a lot of things, but it's safe to sum up that I write&#8212;code, journals, design sketches, and the occasional blog post about my work and travels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Developing software feels like a calling to me if anything does, and it plays nicely with my other interests: music, design, fiction, foreign languages, cities&#8212;areas that help me connect with other humans and know what it means to be alive. These complements keep me from becoming a robot sooner than I have to.
				</p>

				<p>
					I study Software Engineering at Arizona State University. I've been flirting with a bunch of possible secondary concentrations for my final two years there. I'm currently taking time off to intern for <a href="http://prezi.com" target="_blank">Prezi</a> in Budapest, Hungary.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you think we should talk, I'd love to meet. Conversing with good people is my favorite thing in the world.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's talk.
