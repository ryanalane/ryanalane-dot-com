			<h2 class="title">The Winter</h2>
			<p class="description">
It was three days after the semester's last final, and I was absolutely spent. Exhaustion of the existential variety, brought on not by academic intensity but a creeping realization that my passion for pursuit had itself been creeping away. In my hand I held a return ticket that told me home was New York City for a while. Nice, I guess.
			</p>
			<p>
And filled me they did.
</p>
<p>
The process was agonizingly steady. The city weaved itself into me as the weeks passed quietly. I learned the subways and streets in little pockets that grew outward and merged. Weekdays were spent developing software in concentrated blocks, and their accumulated momentum taught me to build substantially again. Weekends were spent exploring the mythical place with new introductions (who I could have sworn were old friends). I ate, I drank, I sat in parks. I looked out over water. I stared at fountains as twilight rolled into night. I read and wrote and strummed my way through the stillness of the summer’s outset. My leisure time quickly filled itself with these discrete moments that I desperately needed. I soaked up everything—filling my brain and heart in ways long neglected. I, the perpetual sponge, moved my feet through the streets.
</p>
<p>
As for my work at the MTA: I built a simple tool to make a modest improvement in bus operations at best, to prove an important concept at least. Either way, the work became intensely personal. I was reminded why I love working in technology in the first place, and I left a more fulfilled, capable, and hungry developer than when I first slid my MTA ID card through that 2 Broadway turnstile. The why—or at least one of them—reveled itself again. This and the rest of my fleeting time in majestic New York left me full in heart and mind. Filled again, if only partially quenched.
</p>
<p>
I have no complaints, no regrets, and much gratitude for my first two undergraduate years. And while I walked away from them slightly worn, I view the future with a sharpened eye and a rediscovered light. May’s fragility cowers in sharp contrast to where I stand today. New York sparked a clarification of the utmost importance—one of intention, of engagement, of pursuit.
</p>
</p>
<p>
In a few hours, I walk onto another plane heading even further east—to Budapest, where many professional and personal directions spawned just a summer prior. I know that when I settle into that Andrássy flat, I will be carrying New York’s momentum with me. The momentum to find where all this yet-written code will go, where all this desire for creation will be expressed. For this round, I am thankfully far from dry. And as the waves of Hungary wash over me, I have every intention to return dripping with life.
